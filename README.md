Enhancing website of greenwood community
STEPS TAKEN FOR THE CAPSTONE PROJECT
CREATED a new repository in my GitHub account, with the name GREENWOOD-LIBRARY-WEBSITE
A description was also added: "Enhancing website of greenwood community."

The weblink (HTTPS was copied from the GitHub.  Visual studio Code (VSC) terminal was used for our version control,
The git account was cloned into our local machine  (git clone <HTTPS>)
having only the main branch, we created html files as requested using the codes: "notepad home.html", "notepad about_us.html","notepad events.html", and "notepad contact_us.html". 
These files were then added to git for streaming using code (git add ) from our VSC terminal.
Next was to commit the files ( git commit -m) with a message (-m): "This is the initial commit for team".
Then we used (git push origin main) to push the work with the sections to the main branch on Git Hub.
a new branch was created PS C:\Users\ben61\greenwood-library-website> git checkout -b add-book-reviews
