With only the main branch, we created HTML files as requested using the codes "notepad home.html," "notepad about_us.html," "notepad events.html," and "notepad contact_us.html." 
These files were then added to git for streaming using code (git add ) from our VSC terminal.

Next was to commit the files ( git commit -m) with a message (-m): "This is the initial commit for team".
Then we used (git push origin main) to push the work with the created files to the main branch on Git Hub.

before an update was pushed from branch, we made sure the team from the branch is upto date by pulling from the main into the local machine to get the latest update before adding the updated version of his work and pushing to branch for review and merge with the main repository.
